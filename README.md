# Projects
Collection of relevant projects I developed pursuing my Bachelors of Science at the University of Minnesota.

# Operating Systems (Csci 4061) (Language: C)   
  These programs were written entirely by myself and partner, Azul Bolanos, with no framework given.     
  Each has a README with a description and summary of the work done.    
  - OS_mymake:  
    This program is an implementation of the Unix command 'make'.  
    Subjects: Process spawning (fork, exec), DFS stack implementation, input tokenizing.    
    Grade: A+   
    
  - OS_MapReduce:  
    This program is an implementation of the Map-Reduce model of programming.  
    Subjects: Directory traversal, Inter-process communication, file redirection.  
    Grade: A
  
  - ThreadedWordCount:    
    This program is a practice on multi-threaded synchronization and the Producer/Consumer model.   
    Subjects: Threads, Mutex Locks/Condition Variables, File I/O    
    Grade: ?
    
  - NetworkedMapReduce:\
    A different execution of the MapReduce program with intra-process communication over a TCP/IP network.\
    Subjects: Client/Server, TCP/IP networking, Multi-threading, process spawning, concurrency/synchronization.\
    Grade: ?
    
# Advanced Programming Principles (Csci 2041) (Language: Ocaml)
  - tautology.ml:  
    Tautology checker for propositional logic expressions  
    Subjects: High-level recursion, pattern matching    
    Grade: A
      
  - PureLispScanner:    
    Scanner for a Pure Lisp Interpreter, it receives a Lisp expression and tokenizes it for a Parser to evaluate.   
    Contains source code (makeScanner) and a test file (exclaim.in)   
    Subjects: Higher-order functions, environments, closures    
    Grade: ?
