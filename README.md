# Projects
Collection of relevant projects I developed pursuing my Bachelors of Science at the University of Minnesota.

## earthquakes (C++):
  * This program was an exercise in low-level graphics programming. It creates a detailed mesh of the Earth in space, then interfaces    with public data from NASA of every earthquake reading since 1910. It iterates through each year up to the 2000s and displays every earthquake that happened in the last year at it's corresponding location on the globe.
  
## Text Rain (Java - Processing):
  * An interactable graphics program written in the Java-based Processing environment. Letters fall from the top
  of a webcam like rain and you can lift them up/move them around with your body.
  
## Car Soccer (C++):
  * A small game based off Rocket League made as an introduction to the MinGfx graphics toolkit, utilizing the OpenGL API.
    Drive a car around and hit a soccer ball into a goal with realistic simulated physics.

## Operating Systems (Csci 4061) (Language: C)   
  These programs were written entirely by myself and partner, Azul Bolanos, with no framework given.     
  Each has a README with a description and summary of the work done.    
  - OS_mymake:  
    This program is an implementation of the Unix command 'make'.  
    Subjects: Process spawning (fork, exec), DFS stack implementation, input tokenizing.    
    Grade: A+   
    
  - OS_MapReduce:  
    This program is an implementation of the Map-Reduce model of programming.  
    Subjects: Directory traversal, Inter-process communication, file redirection.  
    Grade: A
  
  - ThreadedWordCount:    
    This program is a practice on multi-threaded synchronization and the Producer/Consumer model.   
    Subjects: Threads, Mutex Locks/Condition Variables, File I/O    
    Grade: A
    
  - NetworkedMapReduce:\
    A different execution of the MapReduce program with intra-process communication over a TCP/IP network.\
    Subjects: Client/Server, TCP/IP networking, Multi-threading, process spawning, concurrency/synchronization.\
    Grade: A
    
## Advanced Programming Principles (Csci 2041) (Language: Ocaml)
  - tautology.ml:  
    Tautology checker for propositional logic expressions  
    Subjects: High-level recursion, pattern matching    
    Grade: A
      
  - PureLispScanner:    
    Scanner for a Pure Lisp Interpreter, it receives a Lisp expression and tokenizes it for a Parser to evaluate.   
    Contains source code (makeScanner) and a test file (exclaim.in)   
    Subjects: Higher-order functions, environments, closures    
    Grade: A
